    "description": "Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all clients.",
    "changes": [
        "Added rate limiting middleware using express-rate-limit",
        "Configured different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users",
        "Implemented Redis-based rate limiting for distributed systems",
        "Added rate limit headers to all API responses",
        "Created monitoring dashboard for rate limit metrics"
    ],
    "decisions": "Chose express-rate-limit with Redis store because we need distributed rate limiting across multiple server instances. Authenticated users get 1000 requests/hour while anonymous users get 100 requests/hour. We use sliding window algorithm for smoother rate limiting. Headers are included so clients can implement proper retry logic.",
