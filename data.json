      "description": "Completely refactored the authentication system to support OAuth2 and improve security posture. Migrated from session-based to token-based authentication.",
      "changes": [
        "Replaced session cookies with JWT tokens",
        "Added OAuth2 provider support (Google, GitHub)",
        "Implemented refresh token rotation",
        "Added rate limiting for login attempts",
        "Migrated password hashing to bcrypt with increased rounds"
      ],
      "decisions": "We chose JWT over sessions for better scalability and statelessness. OAuth2 was added to reduce password management burden and improve user experience. Refresh token rotation prevents token reuse attacks. Rate limiting protects against brute force attempts.",
